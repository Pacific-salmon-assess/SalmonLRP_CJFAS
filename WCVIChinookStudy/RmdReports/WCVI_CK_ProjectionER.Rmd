## Sensitivity of Projection-based LRPs to ERs


The sensitivity of projection-based LRPs to exploitation rates is due to variability in productivity and to a lesser extent capacity (spawners at replacement) among inlets. In a sensitivity analysis where productivity and capacity were drawn from the same distribution for each of the 5 inlets (i.e., each inlet was a replicate of each other), we found that the productivity and capacity tended to be lower for random trials and inlets that dropped below the lower benchmark in at least one year. Random trials and inlets with abundances that remained above the lower benchmark over the time-series tended to be more productive and slightly larger (Fig. \@ref(fig:chinook-SRHistEven)). 
```{r chinook-SRHistEven, fig.cap="Distribution of (a) productivity (log alpha) and (b) spawners at replacement, SREP among MC trials, coloured by whether abundances in that trial remained above the lower benchmark or not, under a 45\\% exploitation. The distribution of productivity and capacity were assumed equal among inlets. ", fig.align="center"}

Trials and inlets with low productivity tended to have relatively high Sgen (lower benchmark) values, and a higher frequency of dropping below the lower benchmark. THis variability in productivity among inlets was associated with projection-based LRPs that were sensitive to exploitation rates (Fig. \@ref(fig: chinook-ProjLRPS_Even)).

```{r  chinook-ProjLRPS_Even, fig.cap="Probability of all inlets being above their lower benchmark along a gradient in aggregate abundances within bins of 200 fish, derived from projections over 30 years and 10,000 MC Trials, under a range of average exploitation rates from 5-45\\%, assuming the same distribution of productivity and SREP for each inlets but each trial has its own random draw.", fig.align="center"}

```
When productivity was fixed at the mean value among random trials and inlets, the distribution of spawner-recruitment parameters were the same or similar for trials where abundances dropped below the lower benchmark or remained above it, and the LRP was insensitive to exploitation rate (Fig. \@ref(fig: chinook-ProjLRPS_SameProd) and \@ref(fig: chinook-SRHistSameProd)).

```{r chinook-SRHistSameProd, fig.cap="Distribution of (a) productivity (log alpha) and (b) spawners at replacement, SREP among MC trials, coloured by whether abundances in that trial remained above the lower benchmark or not, under a 45\\% exploitation and constant productivity among trials. The distribution of productivity and capacity were assumed equal among inlets, but each trial has a separate random draw. ", fig.align="center"}

```

```{r  chinook-ProjLRPS_SameProd, fig.cap="Probability of all inlets being above their lower benchmark along a gradient in aggregate abundances within bins of 200 fish, derived from projections over 30 years and 10,000 MC Trials, under a range of average exploitation rates from 5-45\\%, assuming the same disribution of productiivty and SREP for each inlets, but each trial has a separate random draw.", fig.align="center"}

```

When SREP was fixed at the mean value among random trials, productivities were higher for inlets and trials that remained above the benchmarks though the overlap with the inlets and trails was slightly greater than when both productivity and SREP varied among inlets and trials. The LRP varied with exploitation rates but to a less extent than when both productivity and SREP varied (Fig. \@ref(fig: chinook-ProjLRPS_SameSREP) and \@ref(fig: chinook-SRHistSameSREP)).


```{r chinook-SRHistSameSREP, fig.cap="Distribution of (a) productivity (log alpha) and (b) spawners at replacement, SREP among MC trials, coloured by whether abundances in that trial remained above the lower benchmark or not, under a 45\\% exploitation.

```


```{r  chinook-ProjLRPS_SameSREP, fig.cap="Probability of all inlets being above their lower benchmark along a gradient in aggregate abundances within bins of 200 fish, derived from projections over 30 years and 10,000 MC Trials, under a range of average exploitation rates from 5-45\\%, assuming the same disribution of productiivty and SREP for each inlets, but each trial has a separate random draw.", fig.align="center"}

```

Variability in productivity among inlets results in inlet-specific variability in sensitivity to exploitation rates. Inlets with relatively low productivity fall below lower benchmarks more frequently, resulting in divergences in status among inlets and a higher aggregate abundances required for all inlets to be above their lower benchmarks (higher LRP).
